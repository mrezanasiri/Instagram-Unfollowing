# Instagram-Unfollowing

Don't you hate it when someone unfollows you on Instagram but you don't know who it is? New changes in the Instagram API have rendered third-party Instagram follower/following applications obsolete. This is a simple, direct method for checking who unfollowed you (non-followers). Web scraping is powered by Selenium.

Open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and run the script via:

<pre><code> python unfollow_checker.py </code></pre>
