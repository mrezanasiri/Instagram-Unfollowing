# Instagram-Unfollowing

** NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED. Last time I checked, this doesn't work anymore &#9785;. **

Changes in the Instagram API have rendered third-party Instagram follower/following applications temporarily obsolete. This is a simple, direct method for checking who unfollowed you.

Dependencies: Selenium, ChromeDriver

Open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and run the script via:

<pre><code> python unfollow_checker.py </code></pre>
